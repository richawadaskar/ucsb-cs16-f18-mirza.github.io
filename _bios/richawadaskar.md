bio: >
   Hello! My name is Richa, and I am a third year Computer Science undergrad. I am so excited to be your mentor this quarter! 
   I hope to help you understand key concepts during CS 16, which will help develop your fundamentals for the courses that 
   will follow. On campus I am an officer for SB Hacks (UCSBâ€™s annual hackathon)
   and Data Science, and in industry I have interned at Invoca and Microsoft. Outside of academics, I am active in my
   professional engineering fraternity Theta Tau, and I enjoy climbing, dancing, surfing, and playing volleyball. 
   Feel free to email me at richa_wadaskar@ucsb.edu if you have questions about courses, professional career, or life in 
   general.
